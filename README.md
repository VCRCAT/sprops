FAQ:

Q: How do I download this?
A: Use Divran's SVN Tutorial if you are new to SVN. http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=688324

Q: The models in-game don't look like the pictures!
A: The cylinders, tubes, and most models in Misc all use LOD models. This means the further away you are from them, the lower quality they become.
Unfortunately this also means you will have to play with model qualtiy set to High in order to see the real model. Really, you should have this set to
high regardless of your computer, as it only affects those models with LODs anyway.

Q: Can I help with the models?
A: While I appreciate that you would like to help, in order to keep this from becoming the mess that PHX is, I need to keep this as consistent as possible.
That means everything has to be modeled in a specific way, by me. So, no, sorry, but if you have suggestions I am all ears! 

Q: I have no spawnlists!

Fuck optimization, fuck multi-core, fuck sandbox; bring on the shooter gamemodes and new balloon models, thats what the game really needs.

I did not create this addon for facepunch.
I did not create this addon for garry.
